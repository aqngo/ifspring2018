<h1>Blowin' in the Wind</h1>
<h2>Bob Dylan</h2>
	<p>How many roads must a man walk down</p>
	<p>Before you call him a man?</p>
	<p>Yes, ’n’ how many seas must a white dove sail</p>
	<p>Before she sleeps in the sand?</p>
	<p>Yes, ’n’ how many times must the cannonballs fly</p>
	<p>Before they’re forever banned?</p>
	<p>The answer, my friend, is blowin’ in the wind</p>
	<p>The answer is blowin’ in the wind</p>
<br>
	<p>How many years can a mountain exist</p>
	<p>Before it’s washed to the sea?</p>
	<p>Yes, ’n’ how many years can some people exist</p>
	<p>Before they’re allowed to be free?</p>
	<p>Yes, ’n’ how many times can a man turn his head</p>
	<p>Pretending he just doesn’t see?</p>
	<p>The answer, my friend, is blowin’ in the wind</p>
	<p>The answer is blowin’ in the wind</p>
<br>
	<p>How many times must a man look up</p>
	<p>Before he can see the sky?</p>
	<p>Yes, ’n’ how many ears must one man have</p>
	<p>Before he can hear people cry?</p>
	<p>Yes, ’n’ how many deaths will it take till he knows</p>
	<p>That too many people have died?</p>
	<p>The answer, my friend, is blowin’ in the wind</p>
	<p>The answer is blowin’ in the wind</p>
